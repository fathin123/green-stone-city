Control when content (or revisions) appear or disappear in your posts through a new Gutenberg block.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a way to make content either magically appear or disappear at a given time in the Block Editor. The block is based on your site's timezone, giving you complete control over the timing. Possible usage for this includes:

* Displaying special messages for a certain period of time (eg. "Merry Christmas!" only on the 25th December)
* Starting a sale and offering temporary vouchers or coupons
* Holding a giveaway that prevents entries after a certain time has passed

In all cases, your content would be revised automatically once the time has passed - no more having to be online exactly at a certain date and time to update your site!

== Instructions ==

After activating the plugin, you can insert the "Schedule Revisions" block in the Block Editor, and then schedule any blocks of your choosing. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= If I've hidden content, is there any way for my readers to view it before the time has passed? =

No, there isn't - your content will be safely hidden until that time has passed.

= Do you provide support for this plugin? =

Feel free to send an email or a message with any issues - I'll try to respond quickly!
